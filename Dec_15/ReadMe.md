Check if the triangle is valid with for the given angles.(sum of angles must be 180)
Check if the triangle is valid with it's given sides.
a + b > c
a + c > b
b + c > a

x = 2
y = 5
z = 0

find values of the following expressions:
a) x == 2
b) x != 5
c) x != 5 && y >= 5
d) z != 0 || x == 2
e) !(y < 10)

Finding max of 3 numbers using nested if-else block.
Check if the triangle is valid with it's given sides. Note: do check for negative numbers, and zero-length sides.
Check if the Quadrilateral is valid for the given  4 angles.
Write a program that takes user input and keeps displaying the first and second digits for the entered number.
        Example 1 : User input : 14215 => output: 1,4 
        Example 2:  User input : 6654908 => output: 6,6
        
        Copy paste these lines to get user input in java.
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in)
        int num = s.nextInt()
        Also the code should run continuously without terminating until the entered value is -1 , that is after displaying the output it MUST ask for another number as input
        
Check if the given char is vowel or consonant, check for uppercase and lowercase, and print accordingly.

Is array dynamically allocated or statically allocated  => dynamic allocation happens at runtime.
Why do arrays have 0 based indexing. 
    => baseAddress +(offset-1 * sizeof(datatype)) 
    To get rid of that extra -1 , arrays start at 0 index.

How are address to array loc are provided by JVM?



Assigments:
---------------------------------------------
1.Check if two strings are anagrams or not, if they are print TRUE else print FALSE.
2.Create an array of size 10 and take 2 inputs first the index and second the value and place the value at that given index, if the index is out of range then display an error message and ask for another valid index.
        example:  Enter index and value to store in arr
                          5, 10 => store 10 at arr[5] 
 3.Take a static array of size 10 and a target , find 3 elements(triplet) in the array which sum up to  target, if there exists such a triplet then display their indexes.
